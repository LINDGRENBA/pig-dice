## Description

_This is a dice game translated to a webpage. Roll a dice and you get that many points. Roll as many times as you'd like and add the points up. If you roll a 1 you lose all your points from that turn and give the dice to the next player. At any point before rolling a 1 you may choose to hold, add the points to your total and give the dice to the next player. 1st to 100 points wins_
